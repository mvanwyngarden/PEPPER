# PEPPER (Primordial, corE-Powered, or PhotoEvaporation Radius valley)

PEPPER tests photoevaporation, core-powered mass loss, and an accretion-limited primordial radius valley model against planetary systems with multiple planets spanning the exoplanet radius valley. 
Each model returns the minimum core mass of the gas-enveloped planet required for the system to be consistent with a given radius valley emergence mechanism. 
This minimum mass can then be compared to measured masses for enveloped planets when available to test if a given mechanism can explain the observed system architecture. 

PEPPER requires a planet above and below the radius valley (i.e. a rocky and enveloped planet) in order to perform this analysis. All three models require the user to specify a minimum of eight required planetary and stellar parameters. 
The user is also free to specify uncertainties on any of the required input parameters. A tutorial Jupyter notebook is provided in example_Kepler36.ipynb
